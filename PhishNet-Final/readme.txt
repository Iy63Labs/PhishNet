PhishNet Browser Extension
Version: 2.0
Developers: Brandon, Luka, Naila, Ibrahim

Overview:
PhishNet is a powerful browser extension designed to protect users from phishing attempts. It uses an advanced database of suspicious keywords, URLs, and patterns to quickly identify and block potential phishing threats. With its enhanced capabilities and user-friendly interface, PhishNet offers state-of-the-art protection in today's complex digital landscape.

Key Features:
1. Advanced Phishing Database: Contains a vast collection of suspicious keywords, URLs, and patterns.
2. Real-Time Threat Detection: Quickly identifies known phishing attempts as you browse.
3. API-Enhanced Data: Integrates with services like OpenPhish for up-to-date threat information.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Modern design with intuitive navigation and engaging visuals.

How It Works:
1. Automatic Tab Scanning: PhishNet automatically detects if any opened tab is a phishing site.
2. Manual URL Check: Paste any URL, and PhishNet double-checks it for safety.
3. History Tracking: View a log of all detected phishing attempts with date and time.

Usage:
1. Look for the PhishNet icon in your browser's toolbar.
